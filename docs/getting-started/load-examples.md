To follow along with the examples, you will need to clone the project to your computer and load the example projects. Cloning a project with git means creating a local copy of it on your computer.

- Git on the command line. Tutorials are available at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
- A git desktop client like [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Source control management in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
1. Use the `File > Add Folder to Workspace` dialog to find and open the local `DSL` folder that was created when you cloned the project.
