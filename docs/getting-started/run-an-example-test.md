# Run Your First Example Test

1. The example tests in the [Possum Labs DSL example project](https://github.com/Possum-Labs/DSL) require Docker to run browsers for testing websites. Before you run your first example test, follow the instructions on the [[Docker](Docker) page to download and install Docker and spin up a Selenium grid.
1. Open the file `DSL > Tests > Possum Labs DSL Integration Tests > features > Google.Feature` in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
