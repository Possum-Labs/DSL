# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the contribution guide. There are several different ways you can help make this project better if you have timeâ€”first, please report bugs! 

## Bugs
There are bugs in this code. I mean, we don't know where they are yet, but there is too much code for there not to be bugs. So when you see something that looks like a bug, please let us know.  The artifacts we would love to have are stack traces, expected behavior, and reproduction projects if you have the time. 

If you have a flaky or non-reproducible bug, please still let us know. We might not be able to fix it with the information you provide, but it can add to data from other users to help us track the issues down.

## Feature requests
This project has the solutions to the shared testing problems between a few systems. This sample size means that many other common issues are a good fit for the PossumLabs.DSL project. We can't promise that we will be able to implement them all, but we'd love to hear about any ideas. 

Feature requests do not have to be limited to functionality and can include requests for tutorials or documentation.

We will prioritize features based upon ease, fun, perceived value, and how well they fit the DSL testing idea. 

## Code Reviews
A large part of the PossumLabs.DSL project was written by one person without collaboration. This lack of feedback is a known weakness of the project, and there are areas where the solutions to the problem are not optimal. So if you are willing to take the time to review part of the code and provide feedback, it would be greatly appreciated. 

It is always easier to understand feedback with context, so if you could share examples of where a particular pattern caused issues, it would be appreciated. 

## Contributing Code
Take a look at the code to see if you would like to work on this codebase. There are video introductions below for the separate projects to help you get started. The next step is to choose something you would like to implement. Feel free to reach out to bas@possumlabs.com to set up some time to discuss the plan if you'd like. 

From a code perspective, we care about a few things. First of all, aim for DRY: Don't Repeat, Yourself. If you find yourself copy-pasting code, assume that it doesn't adhere to DRY and try to find another solution if possible. The second is the Single Responsibility Principle: if you can't describe what a class or method does without using "and," you probably need to break it up into multiple classes or methods. Lastly, please name things well, which will hopefully be easier if the Single Responsibility Principle has been honored. There are many other great practices, and feel free to use the ones you like. 

The goal is to keep the code organized and fun to work on while keeping tests written using PossumLabs.DSL passing.
