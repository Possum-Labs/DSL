## DSL.Core Tutorials

The tutorials fall into three categories: Core for the parts dealing with variables, Web for interacting with webpages, and an Advanced section that talks about replacing and modifying components of the framework. This section is the Core section, where you'll learn how the PossumLabs.DSL framework can help you define data for your scenarios concisely and powerfully. 

We will start by introducing entities; then, we will explore the different types of aspects that can describe the entities. All of this will result in the final tutorial, where we will put it all together and create a complex data scenario that leverages all of these concepts. 

A driving force of the PossumLabs.DSL project is to allow for the creation of a concise data definition for scenarios. This conciseness is important because of two reasons. First, the tooling for Gherkin is not fantastic when it comes to refactoring. So less code means that you have a better time in the long term maintenance of the Gherkin in your scenarios. The second reason is that complicated and irrelevant data setup detracts from the clarity of the actual tests. 

All tutorials in the Core section have both a version that is based on the PossumLabs.DSL.Core package and another based on the PossumLabs.DSL.English package. The English version is always simpler, because it leverages more of the common infrastructure. The Core version allows you to avoid the dependency on the Selenium packages that PossumLabs.DSL.English has.
